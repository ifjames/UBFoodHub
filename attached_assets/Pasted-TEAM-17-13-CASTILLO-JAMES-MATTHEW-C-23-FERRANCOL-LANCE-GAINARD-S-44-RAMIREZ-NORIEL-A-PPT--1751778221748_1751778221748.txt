UB FoodHub: A Web-Based and Mobile-Responsive Food Ordering System for University of Batangas Canteens

Tech Stack:
Web-based system (Tailwind CSS, React, Vite, Firebase, Node.js), Mobile-responsive (accessible via browser on mobile devices)
Overview:
In many schools, especially in the Philippines, where break times are short and student populations are large, canteens often become overcrowded and disorganized during lunch or recess. Students are forced to spend most of their break lining up, deciding what to eat, or waiting for their food, which results in wasted time and increased stress.
OrderNa is a web-based and mobile-responsive food ordering system specifically designed for school canteens. It enables students to browse the menu, customize their orders, and securely place them online before arriving at the canteen. Once the order is placed, the system generates a unique QR code, which students present upon pickup minimizing wait times and eliminating long queues.
The system streamlines canteen operations and empowers students to maximize their limited break time without compromising meal options or quality of service.
Rationale:
Time can often feel limited during school hours, especially for high school students and even college students with back-to-back classes or tight schedules. In many schools, break periods overlap, leading to crowded canteens and long queues during peak hours. Students often have to:
Look for a stall that offers what they want
Decide on a meal quickly under time pressure
Line up to place their order
Wait again to receive their food


This process can lead to stress, missed meals, or even tardiness especially when break times are short or when students try to avoid long lunchtime rushes.
On the canteen‚Äôs side, staff often struggle with order congestion, miscommunication, and inefficient service during these peak periods, leading to slower operations and reduced customer satisfaction.
OrderNa addresses these challenges by digitizing the food ordering process‚Äîeven before students arrive at the canteen. Like the McDonald's or Jollibee app, it enables students to order in advance, reducing physical queues, speeding up service, and allowing both students and staff to make better use of their time.

Problem & Solution Matrix
Problem
How OrderNa Solves It
Long queues and wasted time during breaks
Pre-order system reduces line buildup
Confusion or delays at stalls
Organized QR-based pickups
Missed meals or late returns to class
Time-efficient ordering during class or before breaks
Manual/stressful order taking for canteen staff
Digital dashboard automates order management

Use Case Scenarios:
1. Short Break Rush
Miguel has only 10 minutes for recess. Instead of racing to the canteen, he orders through OrderNa during his earlier class. When break time comes, he walks straight to the pickup area and gets his food in under a minute.
2. Canteen Staff Optimization
The canteen staff logs in to see orders placed in real-time. Each order appears with a timestamp and QR code. They prepare meals in advance and simply scan codes when students arrive‚Äîspeeding up service and reducing pressure.
3. Mobile-Friendly Convenience
Liza, a student without a laptop, uses her phone to access OrderNa. Thanks to its responsive design, she navigates the site smoothly and places an order even while walking to her next class.
