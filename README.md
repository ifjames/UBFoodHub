# UB FoodHub - Secure Mobile Web Application

A comprehensive, security-first mobile web application for the University of Batangas canteen ecosystem, designed to streamline food ordering with enterprise-grade security measures.

## üîí Security-First Architecture

UB FoodHub implements multiple layers of security to protect user data and prevent common web vulnerabilities:

### Authentication & Access Control
- **Multi-layered Authentication**: Firebase Auth with UB domain restrictions (`@ub.edu.ph` only)
- **Email Verification Enforcement**: Users must verify their email before accessing core features
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Strict permissions for Students, Stall Owners, and Admins
- **Session Management**: Auto-logout after 30 minutes with 5-minute warnings
- **Account Lockout**: 5 failed login attempts trigger 15-minute lockout
- **Password Strength Validation**: Enforced strong passwords with complexity requirements

### Data Protection & Validation
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized on both client and server
- **Firebase Security Rules**: Comprehensive Firestore rules preventing unauthorized data access
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints protected against abuse (100 req/min production, 500 req/min dev)
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection against cross-site request forgery
- **XSS Prevention**: All user content is escaped and sanitized

### Order Security & Integrity
- **Order Verification System**: Unique tokens and checksums prevent order tampering
- **Velocity Limits**: Anti-fraud measures limiting order frequency and amounts
- **Ownership Verification**: Orders can only be modified by owners or authorized staff
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all order modifications and status changes
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Automated detection of unusual ordering patterns

### System Monitoring & Logging
- **Real-time Error Monitoring**: Comprehensive error tracking with categorization
- **Performance Monitoring**: Page load times, API response times, and render performance
- **Security Event Logging**: All authentication events and security incidents logged
- **User Activity Tracking**: Complete audit trail of user actions
- **Automated Alerts**: Pattern detection for suspicious activities

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Firebase project with Firestore enabled
- UB email domain (`@ub.edu.ph`) for testing

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ub-foodhub

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your Firebase configuration

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Firebase Setup
1. Create a Firebase project
2. Enable Authentication with Google provider
3. Enable Firestore Database
4. Deploy security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
5. Configure domain restrictions for Google Auth

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend Security Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** with Content Security Policy compliance
- **TanStack Query** for secure data fetching with caching
- **Wouter** for client-side routing with route protection
- **Custom Security Layer** with input validation and sanitization

### Backend Security Stack
- **Express.js** with comprehensive security middleware
- **Firebase Admin SDK** for server-side authentication
- **Rate Limiting** with configurable thresholds
- **Input Validation** using Zod schemas
- **Security Headers** (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

### Database Security
- **Firestore** with granular security rules
- **Role-based data access** with ownership verification
- **Data encryption** in transit and at rest
- **Audit logging** for all database operations

## üîê Security Features

### 1. Authentication Security
```typescript
// Enhanced sign-in with domain and verification checks
export const secureSignIn = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  if (!email.endsWith('@ub.edu.ph')) {
    throw new Error('Only UB email addresses are allowed');
  }
  
  const result = await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
  
  if (!result.user.emailVerified) {
    await signOut(auth);
    throw new Error('Please verify your email before signing in');
  }
  
  return result;
};
```

### 2. Input Validation
```typescript
// Comprehensive validation schemas
export const emailSchema = z.string()
  .email('Invalid email format')
  .regex(/@ub\.edu\.ph$/, 'Must be a valid UB email address')
  .max(100, 'Email must be less than 100 characters');

export const passwordSchema = z.string()
  .min(8, 'Password must be at least 8 characters')
  .regex(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])/, 
    'Password must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character');
```

### 3. Order Security
```typescript
// Secure order creation with integrity checks
export function createSecureOrder(orderData: OrderData): SecureOrder {
  const token = generateOrderToken();
  const order = { ...orderData, token, createdAt: Date.now() };
  const checksum = generateOrderChecksum(order);
  
  return { ...order, checksum };
}
```

### 4. Rate Limiting
```typescript
// Configurable rate limiting middleware
app.use(createRateLimit(60000, 100)); // 100 requests per minute

// Different limits for different endpoints
app.use('/api/auth', createRateLimit(300000, 5)); // 5 auth attempts per 5 minutes
app.use('/api/orders', createRateLimit(60000, 20)); // 20 orders per minute
```
