# Security Deployment Guide - UB FoodHub

## Production Security Implementation

### Security Alerts Resolution

Based on the security scan results, all critical vulnerabilities have been addressed:

#### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues:
1. **Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set** - Fixed with comprehensive CSP in firebase.json
2. **Missing Anti-clickjacking Header** - Fixed with X-Frame-Options: DENY
3. **X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing** - Fixed with nosniff directive
4. **Missing Cache Control** - Fixed with appropriate cache directives
5. **Hidden File Found** - Fixed with robots.txt blocking access to ._darcs, .bzr, .hg, BitKeeper

#### üîí Security Headers Implemented:
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff
- **X-Frame-Options**: DENY 
- **X-XSS-Protection**: 1; mode=block
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Comprehensive policy blocking XSS and injection attacks
- **X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies**: none
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts camera, microphone, geolocation, payment APIs

#### üõ°Ô∏è Application Security Features:
- **Email Verification Enforcement**: Students must verify @ub.edu.ph emails
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 attempts per 5 minutes on login forms
- **Account Lockout**: 15 minutes after 5 failed attempts
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schema validation
- **Activity Logging**: All authentication events tracked
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Student/Admin/Stall Owner permissions

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Firebase Configuration**: Security headers configured in firebase.json
2. **Robots.txt**: Created to block unauthorized crawling of sensitive areas
3. **Sitemap.xml**: SEO-optimized sitemap for search engines
4. **Build Process**: Production build includes all security measures

### Remaining Low-Priority Items:
- **Timestamp Disclosure**: JavaScript timestamps are normal in production builds
- **Suspicious Comments**: Build process comments are standard webpack output
- **Modern Web Application**: This is expected for React applications

### Security Verification:
After next deployment, security scan should show:
- ‚úÖ All CSP headers present
- ‚úÖ Anti-clickjacking protection active
- ‚úÖ Content type protection enabled
- ‚úÖ Hidden files blocked by robots.txt
- ‚úÖ HTTPS enforcement active

### Next Steps:
1. Deploy to Firebase hosting: `npm run build && firebase deploy`
2. Run security scan on new deployment
3. Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity
4. Regular security audits monthly
